		// This is a stupid hack that I hoped that I would never have to write in my career
		// but the *enlightened* individuals over at Microsoft in all their wisdom decided that
		// the order of execution for an Entry should be Completed -> ReturnCommand but at the same
		// time the order of execution for a Button should be Command -> Clicked. This inconsistency
		// is stupid, but the *REAL* problem is the fact that the Completed event fires before the
		// ReturnCommand on an Entry. This is *extremely* detrimental to MVVM, as there is no way to do
		// View-only behaviour on these controls, like... I don't know... clearing a FUCKING TEXT BOX
		// *after* doing the ViewModel behaviour controlled by the ReturnCommand. The text is already
		// long gone and you're left on your ReturnCommand pissing in the wind without any fucking data.
		// Fantastic. Wonderful. Thank you Microsoft, very cool.
		//
		// As a workaround, I have made this event wait for 0.1 seconds before clearing the text, and
		// added some basic debounce as a coping mechanism. Just what I needed late at night with a deadline
		// in like 3 days and like 10 github issues left to close.
