# Coding Standards

To ensure a consistent style and higher quality code, the following coding standards should be followed when contributing to COMP3404:

1. All public classes, interfaces, methods and properties must have a documentation comment.
2. Private fields should be named in camelCase, with a preceding `m_` e.g. `m_myThing`.
3. `using` statements at the top of a file should be sorted and checked. (right click -> remove and sort usings)
4. Classes and structs should be named using PascalCase.
5. Interfaces should be named using PascalCase, with a preceding `I`.
6. Properties and methods should be named using PascalCase.
7. All branches of a conditional statement should use the same format (either with `{}` or without, don't mix them within the same conditional chain)
8. Comments should be made in the format `// Thing`
