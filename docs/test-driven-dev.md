# Design Portfolio - Test Driven Development

We took a TDD approach to our project, implementing test stubs to help us work out what each class and component needed to do in order to work. We made sure to try and cover integration testing, mock testing, user acceptance and unit testing.

## Integration Tests

## Mock Testing

## Unit Testing
This is an example of unit testing that we built for the save-load testing suite. This test is to check the file is successfully saved, which was a key thing we needed to do to create our MVP. This is a good example of TDD because we needed to map out the different states and check that the code behaved as expected once it was implemented.
