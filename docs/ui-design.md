# Design Portfolio - User Interface Design

## Wireframing

When we started wireframing we decided we wanted an easily accessible and straightforward application with clear icons and components for users to optimise their experience. We tried to create a friendly UI that didn't overcomplicate what we were trying to achieve, without any over-the-top graphics or distractions from the main purpose of the app, which was the AI Chatbot component. We did this by placing the chat component on the main page, and making everything else accessible via a side navigation bar.

## UX Influenced Decisions

A lot of our decisions in placement for various buttons and components were influenced by already existing AI chatbots to keep a sense of familiarity for new users who may have used other features before. On top of this, we decided to use icons or emoticons for the buttons to make them easily portable cross-platform like the brief plans for the application to eventually be.
